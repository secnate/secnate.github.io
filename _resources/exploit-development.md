For exploit development, it is necessary to have a solid grasp of Assembly and C/C++. Maybe also Python. I provided some recommendations on my [coding resources page](https://secnate.github.io/resources/coding/) on how to learn them.

Yes, companies [like Microsoft](https://thenewstack.io/microsoft-rust-is-the-industrys-best-chance-at-safe-systems-programming/) have been moving from memory-unsafe languages like C/C++ for critical systems software to memory-safe languages like Rust. However, such migrations take a long time to implement and a significant portion of existing and new third-party codebases will remain in C/C++. And while there have been some recent discussions and rumors about rewriting the Linux kernel in Rust, significant actions haven't been taken yet. I am not even mentioning that there are _plenty_ of bugs that do not involve memory corruption. In other words: there will _still be plenty of juicy targets to attack._
